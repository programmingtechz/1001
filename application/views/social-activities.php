                                <p>To provide clean clothes to those who need them,</p>
                                <p>We collect clothes that have outgrown their usefulness from you, and donate them to the less-fortunate.</p>
                                <p>Our dedicated team will go to in around Chennai childrenâ€™s homage and orphanage hostels and we deliver the same. Every smiling beneficiary is photographed and the picture is uploaded on DAKBRO INC gallery page & Facebook page - which allows the donors to know exactly how their clothes have been utilized.</p>
